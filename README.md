# Wacom Driver Restarter
A little batch file for restarting Wacom Tablet driver to fix various problems with Wacom pen tablet on Windows.

## Why I create this?
Many of my friends are struggling with pen sensitivity problem and they always ask me how to fix this without restarting their computer. They don't have many knowledge with computer and I want to make this easy for them.

So, I created this batch file myself for them and they think it will be great if I share it with the world.

## Note
I've written this a long time ago when I started learning about coding.

This repository will be rewritten into a Wacom Troubleshooter soon.
